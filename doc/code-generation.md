#### For code generation - `NX Generator`

It provides a powerful way with lots of helpers

In order to create a generator

```bash
pnpm nx generate @nrwl/workspace:workspace-generator some
```

Then we can use it

```bash
pnpm nx workspace-generator page wet-rain
```

For using it in a short variant - `package.json`

```bash
"g-some": "nx workspace-generator some"
```
